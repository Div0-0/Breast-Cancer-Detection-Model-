# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model

In this project, we will explore training a logistic regression model, which serves as an introductory approach to logistic regression. We will be using the Breast Cancer dataset, which includes detailed measurements of cells. Each observation in the dataset is accompanied by the diagnosis of the cell, indicating whether it is malignant or not. Our objective is to build a model that can predict the malignancy of a cell based solely on its measurements.
